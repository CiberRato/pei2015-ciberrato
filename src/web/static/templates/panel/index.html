                <p>CiberRato is a robotic competition, which takes place in a simulation environment running in a network of computers. The simulation system creates a virtual arena, populated by obstacles, where a starting grid , a target area, signaled by a beacon, and a home area are integrated. It also creates the virtual bodies of the robots. Participants must provide the software agents which control the movement of the virtual robots, in order to acomplished the competition goal.</p>
                <p>Agents, playing as a team of five, are given the following challenge: starting from their position in the starting grid they must find a specific spot in a maze (target area), have a team meeting inside the target area and then make all the robots go to the home area. Each robot has to be controlled by an independent program, i.e. the team is actually a collection of, possibly identical, programs. Robots are allowed to communicate with each other within given restrictions. Score depends on fulfilment of challenge goals and on suffered penalties.
