                            <strong>What is a Agent?</strong> A agent is a Robot. The robots have the goal of reaching a defined target area on a maze.
                            To do so they have access to a range of sensors like distance sensors that inform him how far from the walls in front of him he is,
                            thereâ€™s also a beacon sensor that informs the robot if he can see the target area from his current position.
                            The main objective for the robot is to reach the target area as fast as possible being that he may be asked
                            to return to the original position as well.
                            <br/>
                            <strong>Who owns the Agent?</strong> The agent belongs to the Team.
                            <br/>
                            <strong>What you can do with an Agent?</strong> You can launch private competitions, where only team members can view those simulations.
                            These simulations are executed in sync mode, which mean, there is no live stream only the result (log) is presented to you.
                            For these simulations you can choose from a variety of maps that are already present on the platform.
                            You can register your agents in any Competition that you enrolled.
